## File Structure

```
SCREEN/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scrcpy_gui.py          # Main GUI application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ launch_gui.bat         # Launcher script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ screen.bat             # Your original batch file (kept as backup)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scrcpy_config.json     # Auto-generated configuration file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # This file
```

## Configuration File

The application automatically creates `scrcpy_config.json` to store:
- Scrcpy installation path
- ADB path (if different from scrcpy)
- Default device IP address
- Default device port

Example:
```json
{
    "scrcpy_path": "C:\\Program Files\\scrcpy-win64-v3.3.1",
    "device_ip": "192.168.1.2",
    "device_port": "33963",
    "adb_path": ""
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Python is not installed or not in PATH"
- Install Python from python.org
- Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
- Restart your computer after installation

### "scrcpy not found"
- Go to Settings tab and verify the scrcpy directory path
- Make sure scrcpy.exe exists in that folder

### "Cannot connect to device"
- Ensure device and computer are on the same Wi-Fi network
- Check if wireless debugging is enabled on your device
- Verify the IP address is correct
- Try refreshing devices in the Connect tab

### "Device unauthorized"
- Check your Android device screen
